I will redesign the Dashboard layout as follows:

1. **Top Section: Checklist Component**

   * Create a new `DashboardChecklist` component to serve as the "Checklist" requested.

   * This will display setup/onboarding tasks (e.g., "Connect AI", "Embed Widget", "Train AI").

   * It will check the current system status (using data from `merchants` or `conversations` tables) to mark items as complete.

2. **Main Content Layout (Grid Split)**

   * Implement a 2-column grid layout (70% / 30%).

   * **Left Column (70%) - System Overview**:

     * Add a **Date Range Filter** (Dropdown: Last 7 days, Last 30 days, This Month).

     * Display the **Performance Overview** (KPI cards) and charts filtered by the selected date range.

     * Move the existing "Performance Overview" section here.

   * **Right Column (30%) - Today's Pulse**:

     * Create a new "Today's Performance" section.

     * Display **Revenue** and **Messages** specifically for the current day (00:00 to now).

     * This section will *not* be affected by the main date filter.

3. **Data Fetching Logic Update**

   * Update `useEffect` in `Dashboard.tsx` to:

     * Fetch "Overview" data based on the selected `dateRange` state.

     * Fetch "Today's" data separately (always filtered for `today`).

4. **Refactoring**

   * Move the `statCards` (AI System, Training, etc.) into the Checklist or a condensed status bar to free up space for the main content.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. Create `src/components/dashboard/DashboardChecklist.tsx`.
2. Modify `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` to implement the new grid layout and filtering logic.
3. Add the necessary Supabase queries for filtered data and "Today's" specific metrics.
