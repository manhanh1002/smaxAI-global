I have completed the security check and verified that no API keys or admin credentials are exposed in the source code or migrations. The `.env` files are correctly ignored by `.gitignore`.

Here is the plan to replace the remote repository content with the new source code:

1.  **Reset Git Repository**:
    *   Delete the existing `.git` directory to start fresh.
    *   Initialize a new Git repository.
    *   Set the branch to `main`.
2.  **Configure Remote**:
    *   Add the remote origin: `https://github.com/manhanh1002/smaxAI-global.git`.
3.  **Commit and Push**:
    *   Add all files to the staging area.
    *   Commit with the message "Replace with new source code".
    *   Force push to the remote repository to overwrite all existing content.

This action will effectively delete all history and files on the remote repository and replace them with the current local source code, as requested.
